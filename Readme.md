# Getting and Cleaning Data

## Course Project

You should create one R script called run\_analysis.R that does the
following.

1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation
    for each measurement.
3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data
    set
4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5.  Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each
    variable for each activity and each subject.

## Steps to work on this course project

1.  Download the data source and put into a folder on your local drive.
2.  Youâ€™ll have a `UCI HAR Dataset` folder.
3.  Put `run_analysis.R` in the parent folder of `UCI HAR Dataset`, then
    set it as your working directory using `setwd()` function in
    RStudio.
4.  Run `source("run_analysis.R")`, then it will generate a new file
    `tiny_data.txt` in your working directory.
