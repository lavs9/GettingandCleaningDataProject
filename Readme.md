# Getting and Cleaning Data

## Course Project

You should create one R script called run\_analysis.R that does the
following.

1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation
    for each measurement.
3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data
    set
4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5.  Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each
    variable for each activity and each subject.

For more details into the working of the run\_analysis.R please have a
look at the run\_analysis.md file which will explain the working of how
the code has been done.
